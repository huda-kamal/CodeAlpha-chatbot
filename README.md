The chatbot created in C++ is a simple console-based application designed to simulate basic conversations with users.
Using predefined responses and a set of rules, the chatbot can understand common user inputs and reply accordingly.
The program processes the user's input, matches it against a set of keywords or patterns, and generates appropriate responses.
It can handle basic interactions such as greetings, farewells, and simple questions about the userâ€™s interests or preferences.
Users can interact with the chatbot by typing in text, and the chatbot will reply until the user decides to end the conversation.
The program allows for easy expansion, enabling developers to add more sophisticated responses or enhance its conversational abilities.
To run the chatbot, users simply need to compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler like g++, and then execute the program in the terminal or command prompt. 
The chatbot provides a fun and interactive way to explore natural language processing concepts in C++, offering a basic introduction to AI and human-computer interaction.
